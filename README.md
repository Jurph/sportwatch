This project is based on the excellent inroads made by the Dutch university students who wrote
this paper (https://www.os3.nl/_media/2013-2014/courses/ccf/smartwatches-hristo-leendert.pdf) and I'm
grateful to them for their work.  My goal is to replicate their results on my own Nike+ Smartwatch
and then begin reading more aggressively from the watch.  It's possible that this will fail horribly.

PDF is included in this repo for those who want to play along at home.

**get-version.py** and **read-eeprom.py** are copied directly from the paper.

Also thanks to the author of http://dan3lmi.blogspot.com/2012/10/sniffing-usb-traffic-different.html for
**bus-comm.py** and information on using the **lsusb** command in linux.
