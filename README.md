This project is based on the excellent inroads made by the Dutch university students who wrote
this paper (https://www.os3.nl/_media/2013-2014/courses/ccf/smartwatches-hristo-leendert.pdf) and I'm
grateful to them for their work.  My goal is to replicate their results on my own Nike+ Smartwatch
and then begin reading more aggressively from the watch.  It's possible that this will fail horribly.
